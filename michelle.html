             Illinois. Michelle's father, Fraser Robinson, was a city-pump operator and a <br>
             Democratic precinct captain. Her mother, Marian, was a secretary at Spiegel's <br>
             but later stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother, Craig. At just 21<br>
              months apart in age, Craig and Michelle were often mistaken for twins.

        <p>   Michelle went on to attend Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, the city's <br>
            first magnet high school for gifted children, where, among other activities, <br>
            she served as the student government treasurer. In 1981, she graduated from<br>
             the school as class salutatorian. </p>
             <p> Following in her older brother's footsteps, Michelle attended Princeton<br>
                 University, graduating cum laude in 1985 with a B.A. in Sociology. <br>
                 She went on to study law at Harvard Law School, where she took part in <br>
                 demonstrations calling for the enrollment and hiring of more minority <br> 
                 students and professors. She was awarded her J.D. in 1988.

        <h2> Marriage</h2><br><br>
        <p>   Michelle and Barack married at Trinity United Church of Christ on October 3, <br>
              1992. They met in 1989, at Michelle's first job as a lawyer at the Chicago firm <br>
              Sidley Austin. Her future husband, Barack, was a summer intern to whom Michelle<br>
               was assigned as an adviser. 
             </p>
        <p>Initially, Michelle refused to date Barack, believing that their work <br>
            relationship would make the romance improper. She eventually relented, <br>
            however, and the couple soon fell in love. After two years of dating, Barack <br>
            proposed.
